      <h1>About: From Humble Beginnings – Magikarp Story</h1>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magikarp is a small, fish-like Pokémon. It is
        primarily reddish orange in color, but has yellow fins and whiskers.
        Magikarp is based on a carp, but it also embodies a popular motif in
        Chinese mythology: according to legend, a carp that leaps over the
        Dragon Gate will transform into a dragon.<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magikarp is known for being one of the weakest
        Pokémon, with poor stats and its most prominent move being Splash, which
        does nothing. However, when it evolves, like the legend it turns into
        the dragon-like Pokémon Gyarados. Magikarp's story of humble origins and
        dramatic evolution has made it a symbol of persistence, growth, and the
        potential for positive change despite initial setbacks. It has become an
        emblem of determination, often referenced in popular culture to inspire
        individuals to keep striving for their goals, no matter how challenging
        the journey may seem.
